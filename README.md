## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

### What I learned

This was my first time using Tailwind for a full project, which was exciting. I still rely heavily on the docs but I've found my development speed vastly increase as I was building this project.

Starting mobile-first was key when building with Tailwind - it avoided me having to write a whole bunch of bodgey workarounds down the line. Tailwind's JIT compiler and purge options made re-compiling my code very fast (before I discovered this I was waiting a couple of seconds with every save before being able to see my progress in the browser 😳).

### Continued development

I've been documenting known bugs in my [Issues tab](https://github.com/james-work-account/ecommerce-product-page/issues) - if you find any others please feel free to raise a new Issue on there! Going forward I'd like to address these bugs and optimise my Tailwind class usage (I've still got a lot of reused code and as a React fanboy I like my reuseable components...).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The "Quick search for anything" feature basically saved me in this project.
- [nekoCalc's PX to REM converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - for converting the Figma file's px values into rem units to use with Tailwind classes.
